# Classy Weather

Classy Weather is a React application designed to provide weather forecasts based on user input. The application features a search functionality that allows users to retrieve weather information for a specified location, display weather conditions with icons, and show temperature ranges for the upcoming days. This project was developed as part of the React Course by Jonas Schmedtmann and focuses on gaining experience with Class-Based React components, prior to the introduction of Hooks.

## Project Goals

The primary goal of this project was to gain hands-on experience with Class-Based React components. By implementing this project, the aim was to understand and effectively use React's class-based component architecture, lifecycle methods, and state management techniques.

## Features

- **Location Search:** Users can enter a location to fetch and display weather data.
- **Weather Icons:** Weather conditions are represented with appropriate icons.
- **Temperature Forecast:** Shows maximum and minimum temperatures for each day.
- **Local Storage:** Remembers the last searched location for future visits.
- **Loading Indicator:** Displays a loading message while fetching data.

## Technologies Used

- **React (Class-Based Components):** Utilized for building the user interface and managing component state and lifecycle methods.
- **Open-Meteo API:** Used for fetching weather data and geocoding services.
- **Intl.DateTimeFormat:** Utilized to format dates into short weekday names.
